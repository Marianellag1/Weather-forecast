## **Description of the Project**
User can see a 5-day accurate weather forecast of any U.S. city. 



## **Usage Information**
User will enter any U.S. city in input field, and city should show up with name, temp and extras.




## **Test Instructions**
When user clicks live, user will be taken to forecast page were user can enter any U.S. city, taken to second page and displayed current data, plus 5-day forecast.




## **Future Improvements**
As user can notice, only one page of two show up in live. When user types in city, next page should load with all data displayed. Only in first script.js && index.html does saving to local storage display && real time update is shown. 
As for display.js && display.html, does data show and connects, but undefined comes up instead of actual data. 
The majority of what was asked for is there, only challenge was displaying the data instead of undefined.
